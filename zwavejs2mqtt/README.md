## About

The Z-Wave JS to MQTT add-on allows you to decouple your Z-Wave network from
your Apex MCU+ instance by leveraging your MQTT broker. It ships with
a web-based control panel, allowing you to configure every aspect of your
Z-Wave network and how they are published in MQTT.

Some advantages and use-cases for this are:

- Compatible with the Apex MCU+ Z-Wave JS integration.
- Your Z-Wave network will keep running between Apex MCU+ restarts.
- You can directly use things like Node-RED with your Z-Wave network, while
  it is available for Apex MCU+ at the same time.
