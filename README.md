# Apex MCU+ Add-ons: The Official Repository

Add-ons for Apex MCU+, allow you to extend the functionality
around your Apex MCU+ setup. These add-ons can consist of an application
that Apex MCU+ can integrate with (e.g., a MQTT broker or database server)
Apex MCU+ configuration (e.g., via Samba or using
the Configurator).

Add-ons can be installed and configured via the Apex Connect+ frontend on
systems that have installed Apex MCU.
