# ESPHome Apex MCU+ Add-On

## About

This add-on allows you to manage and program your ESP8266 and ESP32 based microcontrollers
directly through Apex MCU. All you need to do is write YAML configuration files; the rest (over-the-air updates, compiling) is all handled by ESPHome.

## Example

With ESPHome, you can go from a few lines of YAML straight to a custom-made
firmware.
